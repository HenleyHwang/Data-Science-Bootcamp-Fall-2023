## Practice Questions
1. How do you assess the statistical significance of an insight?
Compute the probability of observing the given data, assuming that the null hypothesis is true, and see if it is less than the chosen significance level.

2. What is the Central Limit Theorem? Explain it. Why is it important?
Standardized sample mean of i.i.d. random variable with finite variance converges in distribution to standard normal distribution. 
This is important because we can approximate distribution of sample mean regardless of how the underlying population is distributed, as long as sample size is large enough.

3. What is the statistical power?
Probability that the test rejects the null hypothesis when alternative hypothesis is true.

4. How do you control for biases?
Randomly assign participants to different treatments.

5. What are confounding variables?
Variable that influences both the dependent variable and independent variable.

6. What is A/B testing?
A randomized controlled experiment for two variants.

7. What are confidence intervals?
An x confidence interval is an interval that contains the true parameter with probability at least x.
